# React Native Core Components - Practical Examples 📱

> Master React Native's fundamental building blocks: View, Text, Image, and ScrollView through comprehensive, production-ready examples.

## 📚 Examples Overview

### Foundation Components
- **`view-comprehensive.tsx`** - Complete View component mastery with layouts, flexbox, and positioning

*Additional core component examples coming as we progress through the learning path:*
- **Text mastery** - Typography, styling, and text handling patterns *(Coming Soon)*
- **Image optimization** - Loading, caching, and responsive images *(Coming Soon)*  
- **ScrollView advanced** - Performance patterns and complex scrolling *(Coming Soon)*

## 🎯 Learning Progression

### 📚 Level 1: Individual Component Mastery
Start with each component individually to understand their unique properties and capabilities:
- **View fundamentals** - Layout container and styling foundation
- **Text components** - Typography and content presentation
- **Image handling** - Asset management and optimization
- **ScrollView** - Content overflow and scrolling patterns

### 🔗 Level 2: Component Composition  
Learn how components work together to create complex, responsive interfaces:
- **Layout patterns** - Combining View and Text for professional designs
- **Content structures** - Image and text compositions
- **Scrollable layouts** - Complex scrolling interfaces with multiple components

### 🚀 Level 3: Production Patterns
Master real-world usage patterns, performance optimization, and accessibility:
- **Performance optimization** - Efficient rendering and memory management
- **Accessibility integration** - Screen reader support and universal design
- **Platform consistency** - iOS and Android design pattern alignment

## 🚀 Testing Workflow

### Quick Start Testing
```bash
# Navigate to playground
cd playground/test-app

# Test View component mastery
cp ../../concepts/02-core-components/view-comprehensive.tsx app/index.tsx
npm start

# Experiment with modifications
# Edit app/index.tsx directly to see real-time changes
```

### Example Development Session
1. **Copy Example**: Choose any `.tsx` file from this directory
2. **Run in Playground**: Paste content into `playground/test-app/app/index.tsx`
3. **Experiment**: Modify properties, styling, and layout patterns
4. **Learn by Doing**: Test different configurations and observe results

- **Cross-platform Consistency** - Maintaining brand identity across platforms

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Essential View Properties
```tsx
style, children, pointerEvents, testID, accessibilityLabel,
onLayout, onStartShouldSetResponder, hitSlop, removeClippedSubviews
```

### Common Layout Patterns
```tsx
// Container patterns
flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center',
alignItems: 'center', padding, margin, borderRadius, backgroundColor

// Positioning patterns  
position: 'absolute', top, left, right, bottom, zIndex
```
